Things I like to do in Berkeley:

* Stay safe during quarantine
* Cook tasty meals
* Study hard for J-Rue's class

My plans over the weekend are:

1. Complete all of the assignments for J-Rue's class
2. Double check that I completed all of J-Rue's assignments
3. Triple check that all the assignments are done
